# TSWD OnlinePortfolio 
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data！

# About me
Hi, I am Ran, a second-year student of the [MAM Program](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/arts-management-master/). I am passionate about visual arts, especially photography. Feel free to browse my photo works(and follow me) on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ranerpaidoupaile/)!

# What I hope to learn
Throughout this class, I would love to learn the design theories and rationales behind data visualization and get practice on GitHub and Tableau on creating data visual dashboards. I would also like to know how to create more accessible data visualization for the general public (viewers who do not necessarily have certain academic backgrounds) I also want to learn new and some cool data visual tools or graphics that I previously did not know about and eventually learning how to use data to tell good and straightforward stories to the audiences. 

# Portfolio
Here are the works I will be doing with this class: (placeholders for now and will be updated as I learn)
# Examples


## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)


## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project.

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/@charlesdeluvio?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">charlesdeluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/K4mSJ7kc0As?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
  

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
