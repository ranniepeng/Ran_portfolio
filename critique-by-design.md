# Critique by Design with Tableau (MakeoverMonday)
### Part 1: Selected visualization and links
Title: [The Cheapest Ways to Get Your Protein Right Now] (https://lifehacker.com/the-cheapest-ways-to-get-your-protein-right-now-1850001760)

### Part 2: Critique and Evaluation Summary
In general, I like the type of chart the visualization used for illustration, the bar chart is really easy for the audience to understand the approximate price patterns of the selected 10 protein sources. Also, the x and y-axis labels and the visualization title can help viewers grasp the main takeaway from this visualization. I think it is very helpful to sort the protein source from the most expansive one to the least expansive which enables viewers to see and understand the trend easily. 
I love the idea of using the photo icons of each protein source with the consideration to attract the viewer's attention and make the visualization more interactive and explicit to the audience. However, I am also concerned that those picture icons can be "too much" in terms of the purpose of this visualization and somehow distracting. It is also questionable if each icon truly represents the data (in terms of what brands of yogurt and milk they were using to collect the price data for these items). I would probably delete all those icons in my design just to make the chart clearer with less confusing and distracting information. Also, the calorie notes under the picture icons confused me a bit. When I glanced at the chart, I assumed that those numbers were the price rather than calorie info, so  it took me a longer time to compare the scale and figure out why 200 calories is higher than 288 calories. I would also delete the calorie information from this visualization to keep it simple and less confusing.

### Part 3: Sketch out a Solution
