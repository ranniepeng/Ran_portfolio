# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II



## The audience
Similar to the earlier understanding of the target audience in part II, the target audience groups are both external people who are interested in museums and internal arts managers. To appeal to both audience groups, I provided background information on the museum's mission and the rationale for the importance of collection and mission achievement in the overview section; I also included further resources and online open sources that arts managers might find helpful in the summary section. Similarly, to make the data more accessible for people with different expertise and experience, I edited with detailed labels and used less confusing graphics in the shorthand story.    

## References
All external references and knowledge are cited in the shorthand story (in the reference section after the summary)
In addition to those references, I've used Unsplash for all the photographs/images included in the shorthand story cited the icons that I used for creating the visuals (football fields and museum icons) from the Noun Project. 

# Final thoughts
If I have more time, I would like to dive more into the financial documents and data resources of the MET to find some relevant data or information that can support my story. I think the essential questions about how museums should maintain their collection and modify related policies are ongoing topics that I will investigate more. Besides the consideration of mission achievement, and public and educational services, museums are also considering donors' relationships when deaccessioned items or accepted artwork gifts. It will be more realistic and interesting, in future iterations, that I can include the consideration of these factors.
