# Outline
## Project Incentive and Topic Discussion
The inspiration for my final project comes from my curiosity about every visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (The MET). As a student who studies arts, I've visited several times to The MET to go to the exhibition and enjoy its permanent collection. Although for each visit I spent 3 to 5 hours browsing through the galleries, I still haven't gotten the chance to visit all the galleries and take a look at all of the artworks on show. Therefore, I am really curious about how many artworks are in the MET's collection and whether there are artworks from one medium or one culture collected more than the others. Besides the initial curiosity, the Museum's collections and their relevance to its mission statement are also crucial for the overall developments and engagements of its served public. 

The rationale for the close connection between the museum's collections and its mission statement can be mainly divided into 4 aspects: Audience Engagement, Educational Value, Relevance to Society, and Long-Term Sustainability. Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the museum's collection and use the MET, (one of the most popular museums in NYC and the United States) as a case study to analyze its mission alignment and collection management. Similarly, many of the discussions of collection evaluation and management are implemented with more qualitative analysis rather than quantitative analysis which can have more barriers for the public to understand and summarize. Therefore, I would like to take a more quantitative approach to analyze the MET's collection with its mission statement, which will help me to better understand and scope of MET's collection in the covered cultures and its potential (and maybe not voluntary) emphasization on its collection. 

## Main questions to be discussed and What to achieve in this visualization project
According to The [MET's mission statement](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met), which states on its website and I quote here: "The Metropolitan Museum of Art collects, studies, conserves, and presents significant works of art across time and cultures to connect all people to creativity, knowledge, ideas, and one another." In addition, under its stated [collection areas](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/collection-areas), there are 19 categories. I would like to investigate how many collections are in each of the categories as well as to create a breakdown of its collection based on the artwork's medium and accession years. From the category and medium breakdown, I would like to create visuals to illustrate its distribution. I would also like to investigate if there are any potential trends or relationships in accessing some particular artwork categories over time. 

In terms of the general achievement and overall goal of this project, I am aiming for a better understanding on the MET's collection's accession and the cultures that are connected with the artworks in its collection. This project and the visualization analyses can be used as an illustration and showcase of a large museum institution's collection considerations and help the audience to better understand the (potential) collections accession trend of the MET more explicitly and quantitatively.
