# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing/storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of the story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience

In general, I would like to target not only anyone interested in art and museum collection developments but also more internal industry-related art/collection managers in this story. For the general public who are interested in art, I would like to provide them with more data and visualization to help them have a concrete idea of a museum's collection and the artworks it holds. For art managers, I hope such storytelling can provide them with a more quantitative approach to understanding and deciding the museum's collection. 

In order to engage with the general public, I will provide sufficient background information and explain the linkage between the museum's mission and its collection to let them know the importance of understanding and the reasons I would like to do this analysis. To engage with the art managers, I would interact more with them in the later sections and call to action, as they are the people who are really making decisions about collection management and how to present better cultures and artwork to the museum's visitors.
