# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing/storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of the story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience

In general, I would like to target not only anyone interested in art and museum collection developments but also more internal industry-related art/collection managers in this story. For the general public who are interested in art, I would like to provide them with more data and visualization to help them have a concrete idea of a museum's collection and the artworks it holds. For art managers, I hope such storytelling can provide them with a more quantitative approach to understanding and deciding the museum's collection. 

In order to engage with the general public, I will provide sufficient background information and explain the linkage between the museum's mission and its collection to let them know the importance of understanding and the reasons I would like to do this analysis. To engage with the art managers, I would interact more with them in the later sections and call to action, as they are the people who are really making decisions about collection management and how to present better cultures and artwork to the museum's visitors. 


## Interview script
> The goals from My research and the questions I intend to ask. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Understanding whether the topic is appealing to the general public and art managers|1.	Are you interested in the topic that I discussed? (Before the story and after the story) |
|Understand the interviewee's background: art or non-art|2.	Did I provide sufficient info for you to understand the background of this story?|
|Noting potential corrections for visualizations|3. Do you find the visualization helpful for you to understand my story?|
|Knowing from the interviewee's perspective to examine if the storytelling that I presented targets the correct audience group|4. Who do you think should be the intended audience?|
|Double-check with the interviewees about the overall flow of the storytelling|5.	Is there anything you would like me to explain more?|


## Interview findings
> Detail findings from interviews, the general descriptions of interviewees are included in the parentheses 


| Questions               | Interview 1 (Student, early 20s, art history background) | Interview 2 (Student, early 20s, non art background) | Interview 3 (Manager, mid 40s, some art background)|
|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
|1.	Are you interested in the topic that I discussed? (Before the story and after the story)|Yes, as an art student, before the story I am interested in the topic and also curious about how many artworks are there in the MET. After the story, I still wanted to know more and dive deeper into collection management and wondering how art managers think about the issues you are talking about.|             |Before the story, I didn't really think too much about the issues in collection management in such a detailed manner. I am interested in the topic after the story.|
|2.	Did I provide sufficient info for you to understand the background of this story?| Yes, I appreciate how you explain the overall mission of the MET and the important connection between its collection and the mission.| As someone from a non-art background, the information you provided is very helpful, so yes.| Yes. I didn't know such info before the talk, so it is really useful for me to understand the context and why this topic interest you. It also helps me to create a general framework on the topic.|
|3. Do you find the visualization helpful for you to understand my story?|Overall, yes. I love how you started with a large number of facts about the MET to explain why you chose this particular museum also the changes between the "intuitive thinking" and the actual breakdown per development are interesting to see. I also like the comparison between the MET and other museums, which helps me to understand why it can be a little more concerning in its collection management. The pie chart is less clear compared to the other ones. You can try to include the percentage of each color in the chart. I am a little confused whether Asian or Greek Art has a higher % in the total collection. |             |Yes, the area chart and the bar chart are easy to understand and I can grasp the key info, which is that the MET holds way more drawings and prints in its collection than other departments. The pie chart and the explanation on the culture emphasis, however, to me is a bit off the topic that it seems to be a separate question that you want to discuss but don't have time to do so.|
|4. Who do you think should be the intended audience?|                                |             |             |
|5.	Is there anything you would like me to explain more|                                |             |             |
